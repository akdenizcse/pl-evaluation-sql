SQL 
Structured Query Language is a programming language which allows us to communicate with and manipulate databases.
Earlies of 1970s, there were 2 young man who works at IBM; Donald Chamberlain and Raymond Boyce. These years, IBM really needs to get Access and do some modification data held in databases, because it means to reach goal easier and more important one : FASTER. So, Chamberlain and Boyce started to develop a new language. Their first attempt  was “Square”, but it was difficult to use according to its own subscript notation. Then in 1973, they tried a new work “SEQUEL”. It is first name of SQL because SEQUEL was a trademark of the UK-based Hawker Siddeley Dynamics Engineering Limited company. They investigated Datalog too much during the developing, because its typing discipline is perfect fits to SQL.

When/why shall we use it?
SQL has a lot of advantages which is given below but for me, it makes it easy to work with is that it hides the complexity of processing. It faces only with database objects.
Some Advantages of SQL :
1-	Requires no coding. (No need to complex codes,just basics.)
2-	Well Defined Standard (ANSI standart language.)
3-	Interactive Language(You can reach complex results within seconds.)
4-	Manipulating Database(That’s what we want)
5-	Extensibility(It can be integrated with other languages.)

In a nutshell, We should use it because, data is important for almost every application.
